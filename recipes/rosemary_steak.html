        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Noo-Noo is a sentient vacuum cleaner who acts as both the Teletubbies' guardian and housekeeper. He hardly ever ventures outside the
            Tubbytronic Superdome, instead remaining indoors and constantly cleaning with his sucker-like nose. He communicates through a series
            of slurping and sucking noises. He occasionally misbehaves and sucks up anything from tubby toast to blankets, which prompts the
            Teletubbies to call him "Naughty Noo-Noo" and give chase. He was blue in the original series and had orange, pink and yellow stripes
            in the revival series.</p>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup red wine</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 sprig fresh rosemary</li>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine the red wine, salt and rosemary in a small bowl. Let stand at room temperature for 2 to 3 hours.</li>
                <li>Heat a large griddle or cast-iron skillet over high heat. Place the steaks on the hot pan, and cook for about
                    8 minutes per side, or to desired degree of doneness. The internal temperature should be at least 145 degrees
                    F (62 degrees C) for medium rare. Pour in the wine mixture, and allow it to boil for a minute. Serve steaks
                    with sauce on a deep platter.</li>
